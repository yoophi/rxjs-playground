### Adding new Examples

Add new examples unders the `/examples` directory.
Each example should be organized under the sub-directory corresponding to its chapter and index.

i.e. Listing 2.3 => `/examples/2/3`

Each example can have three separate files, they should be labeled using the chapter and index

2_3.js
2_3.html
2_3.css

Currently you must also add a new selector option to the front-end as well.
Go into index.html and add:

`<option value="2.3">2.3</option>`

This will allow the new sample to get picked up by the front end.

To start the server run:

`npm install && npm install -g gulp && gulp`

On subsequent runs (if all goes well) you can run just 

`gulp`
